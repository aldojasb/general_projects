# 🤖 Reinforcement Learning (RL)

Reinforcement Learning is a branch of Machine Learning where an agent **learns by interacting with an environment** to achieve a goal. It’s less about feeding the model labeled data (as in supervised learning) and more about **trial, error, and feedback**.



## RL vs Traditional Machine Learning

There are two key differences between **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and typical **Machine Learning (ML)**:

1. **Agent's Action**
    In RL, the **agent’s actions affect the data it receives next from the environment**. In contrast, ML usually assumes the data is static and independent of it's outputs (predictions).
2. **Reward Signal**
    RL uses a **scalar reward** to guide learning-  what actions lead to good outcomes through trial and error.



## Rewards

A **reward** (denoted as `Rₜ`) is a scalar signal received after taking an action. It tells the agent how well it’s doing **at time step t**.

The goal of the agent is to **maximize cumulative reward over time**, not just perform well in the moment.



## The Reward Hypothesis

RL is built on the **Reward Hypothesis**:

> “All goals can be described as the maximization of expected cumulative rewards.”

Example (Power Plant Control):

- ✅ +1 for producing more power efficiently
- ❌ -10 for exceeding safety thresholds



## Agent's Actions

The agent must choose **a sequence of actions** to maximize **future rewards**.

Caveats:

- Immediate rewards might not be the optimal.
- Sometimes, **sacrificing short-term gain** leads to **better long-term outcomes**.



## History vs. State

One of the most **common sources of confusion** in reinforcement learning is the difference between **history** and **state**.

> It might seem like the *state* should just be “everything that happened before” (i.e. the history), but in practice, **state is a concise summary** of that history—**not the entire thing**.



### What is the History?

The **history** at time step `t` is the full record of everything the agent has experienced up to that point:

```tex
Hₜ = {O₁, A₁, R₁, O₂, A₂, R₂, ..., Oₜ, Aₜ, Rₜ}
```

This contains:

- All past **observations** (`O`)
- All taken **actions** (`A`)
- All received **rewards** (`R`)

It’s incredibly detailed—but often too bulky or unnecessary for real-time decision-making.



### What is the State?

A **state** `Sₜ` is a **compressed representation** of the history that contains all the information the agent needs **to decide what to do next**.

```tex
Sₜ = f(Hₜ)
```

This function `f` summarizes the useful parts of history and discards the rest.

> ✅ A good state captures **just enough** about the past to make optimal decisions—nothing more, nothing less.



### Why This Matters

- If you mistakenly treat the **history** as the **state**, your system becomes unnecessarily large and computationally expensive.
- Worse, the agent may get **distracted by irrelevant past details**—leading to poor learning performance.

This brings us to the **Markov property**, which tells us how to define a state that is truly useful for decision-making.



## The Markov Property

A state is **Markov** if it captures **everything** needed to determine the next step:

```tex
P[Sₜ₊₁ | Sₜ] = P[Sₜ₊₁ | S₁, S₂, ..., Sₜ]
```

> “Given the present, the future is independent of the past.”

This means:

- The agent doesn’t need full history.
- A **well-designed state** simplifies learning and planning.



### Example: Rat and Reward Puzzle

![Rat Example](../../images/rat_example.png)

Let’s say a **rat agent** presses levers and hears bells and sees lights before receiving cheese (reward).
Depending on how we define the state:

| **State Design**                    | **What the Agent Sees**                           | **Pros / Cons**                                 |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Last 3 items in sequence            | "Bell → Lever → Light"                            | Small input, fast decisions, might miss context |
| Count of bells/lights/levers so far | "2 bells, 3 lights, 1 lever"                      | Captures trends, not exact order                |
| Full sequence (entire history)      | "Bell, Bell, Light, Lever, Bell, Lever, Light..." | Accurate but computationally heavy              |

📌 **Insight:** How you define the state **greatly affects** learning efficiency.



## ⏱️The One-Step Agent–Environment Loop (based on Sutton & Barto)

At the heart of every Reinforcement Learning system lies a **continuous interaction loop** between the **agent** and the **environment**, formalized as a **Markov Decision Process (MDP)**.

### Sequence of Interactions:

At each discrete time step `t`, the following happens:

1. The **agent** observes the current **state** `Sₜ`.
2. Based on `Sₜ`, the agent chooses and executes an **action** `Aₜ`.
3. The **environment** receives the action `Aₜ`, responds with:
   - A **new state** `Sₜ₊₁`
   - A **reward** `Rₜ₊₁`
4. The agent receives `Rₜ₊₁` and `Sₜ₊₁`, then repeats the cycle at `t+1`.

This interaction yields a trajectory like:

```tex
S₀, A₀, R₁, S₁, A₁, R₂, S₂, A₂, ...
```

This diagram, from Sutton & Barto’s book, formalizes the MDP loop:

- The **agent** produces an action `Aₜ`.
- The **environment** receives `Aₜ`, and in response:
  - Emits the **next state** `Sₜ₊₁`
  - Emits a **reward** `Rₜ₊₁`

![RL diagram](../../images/rl_one_step.png)

> Sutton, R. S., & Barto, A. G. (2018). *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction* (2nd ed., in progress). http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html

Each new state influences future actions, forming a feedback loop. Importantly, this formulation obeys the **Markov property**—meaning future outcomes depend only on the current state and action, not on the full history.



## 🧩 Major Components of a Reinforcement Learning Agent

An RL agent can be thought of as a system that makes decisions by learning from interaction. It may be composed of **three core components**:

------

### 1. **Policy** – “What should I do?”

A **policy** defines the agent’s behavior: **how it chooses actions** based on the current state.

- **Deterministic Policy**: always chooses the same action for a given state.

  ```tex
  a = π(s)
  ```

- **Stochastic Policy**: chooses actions according to a probability distribution.

  ```tex
  π(a|s) = P[ Aₜ = a | Sₜ = s ]
  ```

Used when exploration is important or the environment is noisy.

------

### 2. **Value Function** – “How good is this state?”

A **value function** estimates how much **future reward** the agent can expect from a given state (or state-action pair).

- Helps the agent choose **better states** over time.
- Doesn’t directly pick actions, but it **influences decisions** when paired with a policy.

```tex
V(s) = expected cumulative reward from state s onward
```

------

### 3. **Model** – “What will happen next?”

A **model** is the agent’s internal understanding of how the environment behaves.

- It predicts:
  - **Next state**: `Sₜ₊₁`
  - **Reward**: `Rₜ₊₁`
- Allows the agent to **simulate outcomes** before acting.
- Not all RL agents use a model.



## 🧠 Categorizing RL Agents

Let’s now organize RL agents by how they combine the components above, and clarify **pros, cons, and examples** for each category.

------

### 1. **Value-Based Agents**

- ✅ Uses: **Value Function**
- ❌ Doesn’t explicitly use a **Policy** (it’s implicit—derived from the value function)
- ❌ Doesn’t use a **Model**

Example:

- **Q-Learning** estimates the value of state-action pairs (`Q(s,a)`) and acts greedily.
- **SARSA** (State-Action-Reward-State-Action): Like Q-learning, but updates values using the actual next action taken.

Pros:

- Simple and widely used.
- Good for discrete action spaces.

Cons:

- Struggles with continuous or high-dimensional actions.
- Doesn’t directly represent policy (requires argmax tricks).

------

### 2. **Policy-Based Agents**

- ✅ Uses: **Policy**
- ❌ Doesn’t use a **Value Function**
- ❌ Doesn’t use a **Model**

Example: 

- **REINFORCE**: A basic **policy gradient** method that updates the policy to maximize expected reward.

Pros:

- Naturally handles **continuous action spaces**.
- Can learn **stochastic** or **deterministic** policies.

Cons:

- Higher variance in updates.
- Often less sample-efficient than value-based methods.

------

### 3. **Actor-Critic Agents**

- ✅ Uses: **Policy**
- ✅ Uses: **Value Function**
- ❌ Doesn’t use a **Model**

Example:

- **PPO** – Proximal Policy Optimization: Balances learning progress and stability using a **clipped objective**.

- **A2C** – Advantage Actor-Critic: Computes advantage estimates to reduce variance and improve stability.

- **A3C** – Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic: Runs multiple agents in parallel with independent environments.

- **DDPG** – Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient: For **continuous action spaces**. Actor-critic with deterministic policies.

- **SAC** – Soft Actor-Critic: Adds **entropy regularization** to encourage exploration.

Pros:

- Combines **low variance** from value-based with **direct optimization** of policy.
- Very popular for complex environments.

Cons:

- More complex architecture.
- Balancing value and policy updates can be tricky.

------

### 4. **Model-Free Agents**

- ✅ Uses: **Policy and/or Value Function**
- ❌ Doesn’t use a **Model**

Examples:

- Q-learning, PPO, DQN, A3C, REINFORCE

Pros:

- Easier to implement and train.
- No need to learn or assume environment dynamics.

Cons:

- Can be **sample inefficient**—needs lots of interactions.
- Less suitable for planning or simulations.

------

### 5. **Model-Based Agents**

- ✅ Uses: **Model**
- ✅ May also use: **Policy and/or Value Function**

Pros:

- **Sample efficient**—can plan and simulate.
- Useful when real-world data is costly.

Cons:

- Requires learning or designing an accurate model.
- Model errors can lead to bad decisions (model bias).



## 🔧 Two Main Approaches to Develop Reinforcement Learning Agents

In reinforcement learning, agents can learn through **two broad approaches**, depending on **how much they know about the environment** at the start:

------

### 1. **Planning (Model-Based Learning)**

> The agent has a model of the environment.

- In this approach, the agent **knows in advance** how the environment works (i.e., it has a **model** that describes the dynamics: what happens when it takes an action).
- Instead of learning through direct interaction, the agent **simulates outcomes internally** using the model.

```tex
State → Model → Simulated Next State & Reward → Policy Update
```

✅ Great for low-risk, fast iteration
 ❌ Not applicable if the environment is unknown or too complex to model accurately

------

### 2. **Reinforcement Learning (Model-Free Learning)**

> The agent learns everything through direct interaction with the environment.

- The agent **doesn't know the rules** of the world it lives in.
- It must **explore**, **collect experience**, and **learn from trial and error**.
- This is the most common setup in real-world problems where dynamics are unknown or too complex to define upfront.

```tex
State → Real Action → Observation & Reward → Policy Update
```

✅ More flexible and general
 ❌ Typically requires a lot more data (sample inefficient)

------

**Example 1: Learning to Play Tic-Tac-Toe**

| **Planning Approach**                                        | **Reinforcement Learning Approach**                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The agent is given **all game rules**, and uses **search algorithms** (like Minimax) to simulate future moves and choose the best one. | The agent **plays thousands of games**, learns from wins/losses, and gradually discovers winning strategies via trial and error. |
| Efficient learning with a known model                        | No prior knowledge required                                  |

**Example 2: A Robot Learning to Navigate a Warehouse**

| **Planning Approach**                                        | **Reinforcement Learning Approach**                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The robot is given a **map of the warehouse**, and simulates paths to find the most efficient one using A* or Dijkstra’s algorithm. | The robot starts without a map, explores randomly, and learns optimal paths based on feedback (e.g., delivery success, collision penalties). |
| Works well in static and known settings                      | Adapts to real-world changes like obstacles or delays        |



## Exploration vs. Exploitation

A **core challenge** in RL is choosing between:

- **Exploitation**: Use what you already know to get high reward now
- **Exploration**: Try new actions to potentially discover better rewards later

### Balance is key

If the agent **only exploits**, it may miss better strategies.
 If it **only explores**, it may never get good at anything.

Real-World Analogies:

| Example           | **Exploitation**                  | **Exploration**                |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Restaurant Choice | Go to your favorite Italian place | Try a new sushi bar            |
| Online Ads        | Show top-performing ad            | Show a new variation           |
| Oil Drilling      | Drill where oil was found before  | Explore untested land          |
| Game Playing      | Play the best-known chess move    | Try an unconventional strategy |



> These examples show how **short-term gain vs. long-term learning** is a universal tension.

## 🔍 Prediction vs. Control Problems

Reinforcement Learning problems fall into two broad types:

------

### 1. **Prediction Problem**:

> **Evaluate** how good a policy is.

**Task:**

Given a fixed policy `π`, estimate the **value function**:

```mathematica
V(s) = Expected future reward when starting from state s and following π
```

**Example Use Case:**

- You’ve built a robot's policy and want to estimate *how good it is*.
- You use methods like:
  - **Monte Carlo Estimation**
  - **Temporal Difference (TD) Learning**

------

### 2. **Control Problem**:

> **Find the best policy**

**Task:**

Optimize the policy `π` to maximize reward.

This is harder because:

- You’re both **evaluating** and **improving** the policy.
- The agent must explore, learn value estimates, and update the policy iteratively.

**Example Algorithms:**

| **Method**     | **Solves**           | **Approach**                                    |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Q-learning** | Control              | Value-based: improve policy via Q-values        |
| **SARSA**      | Control              | Value-based with on-policy updates              |
| **REINFORCE**  | Control              | Policy-based: improve directly via gradients    |
| **PPO**        | Control              | Actor-critic: uses both policy + value function |
| **Dyna-Q**     | Control (with model) | Uses planning + learning                        |



------



## Dynamic Programming (DP) Principles and RL

Dynamic Programming (DP) is a **powerful method for solving sequential decision problems**. It forms the theoretical backbone of many reinforcement learning algorithms.

DP is applicable when the problem has **two key properties**:

------

### 1. Optimal Substructure

> The solution to the overall problem can be **built by combining solutions to its subproblems**.

This is the classic **"divide and conquer"** idea.

**Example 1: Shortest Path in a Maze**

- To find the shortest path from A to C, you can split the problem:
  - First solve from A to B
  - Then from B to C
- Combine the results to find the total shortest path from A to C.

------

### 2. Overlapping Subproblems

> **Subproblems recur often**, so instead of solving them over and over, we **cache** (store) their solutions for reuse.

**Example: Robot Vacuum Cleaning a House**

Imagine a robot vacuum learning the **shortest cleaning path** through a house.

- It must figure out how to go from Room A → Room D.
- But to do that, it repeatedly needs to solve:
  - What's the best way from Room A → Room B?
  - And from Room B → Room C?
  - And so on…

Since these room-to-room paths are shared across many larger routes, **the same subpaths appear over and over**.

> Once the robot has figured out how to go from Room A to B efficiently, it can **store that result** and **reuse it** whenever any larger route requires it.

This makes the learning process **faster** and **more efficient**, just like **memoization** in classic dynamic programming.



## Why DP is Relevant to RL?

Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) - the foundation of RL - satisfy both:

- Optimal Substructure ✅
- Overlapping Subproblems ✅

Thus, **we can use DP to solve RL problems** (*<u>when the model is known</u>*).



## Bellman Equations – The Heart of RL

These equations give RL its **recursive structure**. They define how value functions can be **broken down into immediate reward plus future value**.

------

### Bellman Expectation Equation (for a given policy π)

```mathematica
Vπ(s) = E[ Rₜ₊₁ + γ * Vπ(Sₜ₊₁) | Sₜ = s ]
```

**Interpretation:**

> The value of being in state `s` (under policy π) = the **expected reward right now** plus the **discounted value of where you’ll land next**, if you keep following π.

It answers:

> “If I follow this policy, how much reward can I expect to accumulate starting from this state?”



**Real-World Analogy:**

You're using Google Maps to follow a **predefined route** to a destination.

- `Rₜ₊₁` = how enjoyable or efficient your **next road segment** is (traffic, views, fuel efficiency)
- `Vπ(Sₜ₊₁)` = how promising the **rest of the trip** looks from the next junction
- `γ` = how far you care about future road conditions (e.g., close trip vs. cross-country)

So the value of your current location = how good the next step is + how good things look after that.

------

### Bellman Optimality Equation

```mathematica
V*(s) = maxₐ E[ Rₜ₊₁ + γ * V*(Sₜ₊₁) | Sₜ = s, Aₜ = a ]
```

**Interpretation:**

> The optimal value of a state is the **maximum expected return** achievable by choosing the **best action now**, assuming we act optimally from that point on.

It tells us how to compute **V\*(s)** by evaluating all possible actions and choosing the best.



**Real-World Analogy:**

You're now **choosing your own route** on Google Maps, not following a fixed one.

- You consider **all exits from the roundabout**.
- For each one, you calculate:
  - “What’s the reward from taking this exit?”
  - “How good are things from there on?”

Then, you **choose the best path**.



------

### Summary

| Equation                | Purpose                   | Intuition                                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Bellman Expectation** | Evaluate a given policy π | “What happens if I follow the instructions?” |
| **Bellman Optimality**  | Find the best policy      | “What’s the smartest action I can take now?” |



## Planning approach by using Dynamic Programming 

Because DP assumes **full knowledge of the MDP**  - i.e., transition probabilities `P`, rewards `R`, and state/action sets - it’s used primarily for **planning (Model-Based Learning)**.

------

### DP is used for:

#### Prediction (Policy Evaluation):

- **Input**: MDP ⟨S, A, P, R, γ⟩ and policy π
- **Output**: Value function `Vπ(s)`

#### Control (Policy Optimization):

- **Input**: MDP ⟨S, A, P, R, γ⟩
- **Output**: Optimal value function `V*`, and optimal policy `π*`



## Which RL Agent Categories Use DP?

Here’s how DP relates to the **RL agent categories** you explored earlier:

| **Agent Type**   | **Uses DP?** | **How?**                                                     |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Value-Based**  | ✅ Yes        | Uses Bellman backups to compute value functions (e.g., via Q-learning) |
| **Policy-Based** | ❌ No         | Optimizes policies directly without relying on value recursion |
| **Actor-Critic** | ✅ Partially  | Critic uses value estimates based on Bellman updates (TD, advantage) |
| **Model-Free**   | ✅ Indirectly | Value updates follow Bellman logic, but with sampled experience only |
| **Model-Based**  | ✅ Fully      | Can use **DP-style backups** by simulating transitions from the model |



## Policy-Based Algorithms

**Policy-based methods**:

- **Don’t use value functions** explicitly (though they sometimes do, like in actor-critic).
- **Don’t perform backups or rely on recursive decomposition via the Bellman equation.**
- Instead, they treat the **policy itself as the thing to optimize**.



## Why You Can't Use DP with Pure Policy-Based Algorithms

Dynamic Programming works by recursively estimating values of states or actions.
But **in policy gradient methods**, the policy is **parameterized (e.g., with a neural network)**, and we **directly adjust the parameters to maximize expected return**—not via value recursion.

So:

|                  | **DP-based methods**                       | **Policy-based methods**                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| What is updated? | `V(s)` or `Q(s,a)` using Bellman equations | `π(a)`                                      |
| What is needed?  | Full model (`P`, `R`)                      | No model needed (can use sampled rewards)   |
| Algorithm type   | Planning                                   | Optimization via stochastic gradient ascent |
| Backup type      | Recursive                                  | Sample-based Monte Carlo or TD estimates    |



## So What Do We Use Instead of DP?

Policy-based algorithms use **gradient-based optimization**, not Bellman backups.

There are two major categories:

------

### 1. **Monte Carlo Policy Gradient**

- Estimate total return from sampled episodes.
- Use this to compute the gradient of the expected return w.r.t. the policy parameters θ.

**Classic example: REINFORCE**

```mathematica
θ ← θ + α * ∇θ log πθ(a|s) * Gₜ
```

Where:

- `Gₜ` is the return from time `t` onward.
- `∇θ log πθ(a|s)` is the gradient of the log-policy.

✅ Doesn't require value function or model
 ❌ High variance in gradient estimates

------

### 2. **Actor-Critic Methods**

Hybrid methods where:

- The **actor** is the policy being optimized.
- The **critic** estimates a value function (usually via TD learning) to reduce variance.

Examples:

- **A2C** (Advantage Actor-Critic)
- **PPO** (Proximal Policy Optimization)
- **DDPG**, **SAC**

Here, the **critic may use Bellman-style updates**, but the policy update is **still gradient-based**, not DP.
