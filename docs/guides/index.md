# Welcome to My Software & Data Science Portfolio

This portfolio showcases my expertise in **software architecture, unit testing, deep learning, and applied projects**. The goal is to document best practices, key principles, and hands-on experience in designing scalable, maintainable, and efficient software systems.

## 📌 What You'll Find Here

- **Software Architecture**: Principles and patterns that enable flexible, scalable, and maintainable systems, including **SOLID principles and Clean Architecture concepts**.
- **Unit Testing**: Best practices using **pytest**, covering effective test structures, mocking, and CI/CD integration.
- **Deep Learning**: Learning projects related to **autoencoders and reinforcement learning**, demonstrating key techniques and applications.
- **Projects**: A showcase of real-world applications and hands-on implementations that reinforce these concepts.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Portfolio

This collection of guides and projects serves as a **learning resource** and a **technical showcase** for recruiters, employers, and fellow developers. Whether you're exploring software design patterns, refining your testing skills, or diving into AI/ML topics, you’ll find structured content here.
