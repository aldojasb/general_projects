## ðŸ›¹ **The Skateboard Mindset: A Practical Approach to MVPs**  

*(Based on Henrik Knibergâ€™s article on [Making Sense of MVP](https://blog.crisp.se/2016/01/25/henrikkniberg/making-sense-of-mvp))*

### ðŸ”¹ **What is the Skateboard Mindset?**  

The **Skateboard Mindset** is an approach to building **Minimum Viable Products (MVPs)** with a focus on **usability and value delivery** rather than just isolated functionality.  

Instead of **delivering incomplete parts of a system**, this mindset encourages teams to create **small but functional iterations** that **work from day one**.  

### ðŸ›  **How It Works**  

ðŸ”¹ **Traditional MVP Mindset (Flawed Approach)**  
A common mistake when building an MVP is treating it as a **step-by-step assembly of the final product**. Example:  

1. **Wheels** â†’ ðŸš« No usability yet.  
2. **Chassis** â†’ ðŸš« Still unusable.  
3. **Car Frame** â†’ ðŸš« Still not functional.  
4. **Final Car** â†’ âœ… Finally usableâ€”but only at the end.  

ðŸ”¹ **The Skateboard Mindset (Better Approach)**  
Instead, we **start with a small, usable product** and **iterate towards a better version**:  

1. **Skateboard** â†’ âœ… Basic but functional.  
2. **Scooter** â†’ âœ… More comfort & usability.  
3. **Bicycle** â†’ âœ… Faster, scalable improvement.  
4. **Motorcycle** â†’ âœ… Improved efficiency.  
5. **Car** â†’ âœ… Fully featured, refined product.

### ðŸš€ **Why It Matters**  

âœ” **Delivers value from day one**â€”each iteration is a usable product.  
âœ” **Encourages user feedback early**, reducing risk.  
âœ” **Prevents waste** by validating real needs before overbuilding.  

This mindset **helps teams prioritize features that deliver real user value**, ensuring software evolves in **functional, testable stages** rather than incomplete fragments.
