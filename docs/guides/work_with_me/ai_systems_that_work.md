From prototype to production - building AI tools that fit your architecture, scale with your needs, and deliver business value.



## **From Intuition to Hypothesis and Prototype**

> Explore bold, high-risk, high-reward ML ideas - and transform unstructured curiosity into structured insight.

Some ideas aren’t ready to be shipped. But they *are* ready to be explored. You have an intuition - about human behavior, chemical interaction, education patterns, social data - and you’re wondering: Can machine learning help us make sense of this?

That’s where I come in.

I help teams explore questions that don’t yet have a roadmap. Together, we frame your idea as an ML research question, gather or simulate data, and run exploratory models to test what’s worth pursuing further.

You don’t just get code. You get insight, analysis, and structure - and a clear recommendation on what to do next.



## **From Prototype to Product**

> Refactor and re-engineer AI prototypes or research code into scalable, maintainable products.

You’ve proven your model works. The numbers are there. The logic makes sense. But outside your team, no one’s using it - because it’s not packaged, tested, or integrated with an U.I. tool or other tools that the business already relies on.

That’s where I come in.

I take your existing prototype - in whatever shape it’s in - and turn it into a deployable AI product: one that runs in production, connects to real systems, and is robust enough to evolve over time.

So your business doesn’t just “have a model.” It has a working product.



## **Develop Simulation & Digital Twin Environments**

> Develop virtual environments to simulate processes, test decisions, and train AI agents like reinforcement learning systems.

You want to test a new operating strategy. Or see how an AI system reacts to failure. But in the real world, every test is a risk in time, cost, or safety.

That’s why I build digital twins: realistic, programmable environments where your team can experiment freely, fail safely, and learn fast.

It’s not about simulating for simulation’s sake. It’s about creating a low-risk sandbox where bold decisions become informed ones - before they hit your operations. Before you deploy, we simulate. So when it’s live, it works.



## **Design Business-Wide Visualization & Monitoring Dashboards**

> Design and build centralized dashboards that unify operational data, performance metrics, and business KPIs - whether or not AI is involved.

You don’t always need machine learning to move the needle. Often, what your team really needs is **clarity** - the ability to see what’s happening, spot trends, and make smarter decisions.

I help companies unlock the value of the data they already have - by building **insightful, interactive dashboards** that tie together operations, finance, customer behavior, and more.

Even if AI is on the roadmap, dashboards are the first step to getting everyone aligned, asking the right questions, and spotting the opportunities that were already there.

Sometimes, smarter decisions just need better visibility.



## **Design Custom integrated AI projects**

> Design and build custom AI systems or packages that plug into your existing business architecture.


You’ve invested in a third-party AI tool. On paper, it promises everything - predictions, dashboards, automation. But in practice? It’s still not integrated.

Your workflows are too specific. Your data model is unique. The vendor’s API doesn’t quite adapt. Now your team is stuck again in manual process and making decisions by gut.

Sound familiar? This is exactly where I come in.

I design and build custom AI modules that *start* with how your business works. Whether you need a forecasting engine, an internal Python package that wraps ML logic, a smarter way to use your existing data, or a microservice that slots into your backend - we build it to match your architecture and integrate cleanly.

You keep control. Your team stays productive. And this time, there’s no “manual processl” in the workflow.
