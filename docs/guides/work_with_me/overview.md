# AI Solutions That Work

I build AI products that start with business problems - and end with measurable results.

## **Core Services**

### **AI Systems & Products**
- **Intuition to Prototype**: Explore bold ML ideas and transform unstructured curiosity into structured insight
- **Prototype to Production**: Transform research code into scalable, deployable AI products
- **Custom AI Integration**: Build AI modules that plug into your existing architecture
- **Digital Twins & Simulation**: Create safe environments for testing AI systems and business decisions
- **Data Visualization**: Design dashboards that unlock insights from your existing data

### **AI Foundations**
- **AI Readiness Assessment**: Evaluate your infrastructure, data, and team readiness before investing
- **Innovation Lab Design**: Create internal R&D processes for systematic AI experimentation
- **Technical Team Coaching**: Mentor data scientists to build maintainable AI systems
- **AI Culture Training**: Help non-technical teams understand and collaborate on AI initiatives

## **My Approach**

I focus on **business outcomes over technical complexity**. Whether you're exploring bold AI ideas, scaling existing prototypes, or building foundational capabilities - I help you move from intuition to implementation with clear, measurable results.

**From exploration to execution. From prototype to product. From individual experiments to organizational capability.**
