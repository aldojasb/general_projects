Helping teams, leaders, and companies lay the right foundation for AI - before they write a single line of code.



## **Conduct AI Readiness Assessments**

> Evaluate your infrastructure, data, talent, and tooling to ensure your company is truly ready to adopt AI - before you invest.

You’re excited about AI. Your team is curious. Maybe you’ve even started experimenting. But deep down, you might be asking: “Are we actually ready for this?”

That’s exactly what an AI Readiness Assessment is for.

I’ll help you evaluate your current business opportunities, data quality, team skills, and existing tools so you know what’s working, what’s missing, and what needs to happen next.

Whether you’re at step zero or recovering from a failed AI initiative, I’ll give you a clear, actionable roadmap - so your next investment in AI is a smart one.



## **Design Innovation Labs**

> Design and lead the creation of internal R&D or AI innovation units - so your company can explore, experiment, and execute bold ideas with confidence.

You have many AI ideas in your company - from predictive maintenance to smart scheduling and customer churn models. But there’s no clear process to take those ideas from conversation to prototype. With no structure, those ideas might live in spreadsheets, powerpoint presentations, or “experimental notebooks” that will never leave the computer of somebody. And leadership keep asking: “Why aren’t we doing more with AI?”

That’s where I came in.

I work with your teams to design and launch an AI Innovation Lab - starting with your business priorities and internal talent. I help you define a intake process, explore bold ideas, define success metrics, roadmaps, and the tech stack that supports fast experimentation.

You get a repeatable innovation pipeline, not just one-off experiments.



## **Coaching Technical Team for AI Excellence**

> Mentor and upskill data scientists and ML engineers to build scalable and maintainable AI systems - not only experiments.

Great models aren’t enough - they need to live in systems, evolve with feedback, and scale with users.

That’s where I come in.

I coach technical teams to apply product thinking to their AI work - combining scientific creativity with software best practices. We introduce versioning, modular design, testing, and lightweight MLOps so your AI projects stop being isolated experiments… and start becoming real features that users rely on.

Because in the end, AI that works isn’t a proof of concept - it’s a product.



## **Training Non-Tech Teams for AI Culture Adoption**

> Deliver workshops and talks that build data and AI fluency across business teams - so everyone can participate in AI success.

Your data scientists are building models. Your business leaders are making decisions. But if they’re not speaking the same language, even the best AI won’t move the needle. AI isn’t just a technical transformation - it’s a cultural one.

That’s where I help.

I design workshops for business stakeholders - helping them understand what AI is (and isn’t), how to collaborate with technical teams, and how to identify opportunities that make sense for the business.

Because the success of AI isn’t just about good models - it’s about aligned people.
