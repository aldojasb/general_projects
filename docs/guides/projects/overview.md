# Projects: Real-World Applications in Software & Data Science  

This section highlights key projects that bring **Data Science, Software Engineering, and DevOps** concepts to life. Each project is designed to solve real-world challenges and improve efficiency through hands-on implementation.  

## Database Toolkit 
[View on GitHub](https://github.com/aldojasb/general_projects/tree/main/database_toolkit)  

A powerful, scalable solution for generating synthetic datasets tailored to **industrial applications**.  

**Why it Matters?**  
Businesses relying on machine learning models need high-quality training data. This toolkit automates **data generation, anomaly simulation, and dataset merging**, making it easier to test and deploy AI models.  

**Key Capabilities:**  
- Automated generation of structured industrial pump data.  
- Custom anomaly injection for model testing.  
- Flexible **factory design pattern** to streamline dataset creation.  
- Built using **SOLID principles** for maintainability.

A **project template generator** designed to standardize and accelerate the setup of new projects.  

**Why it Matters?**  
Starting a new project often involves repetitive setup tasks. This template ensures that all new projects adhere to a consistent structure and include necessary configurations, reducing setup time and potential errors.  

**Key Features:**  
- Pre-defined directory structures for various project types.  
- Inclusion of essential configuration files and dependencies.  
- Customization prompts to tailor the template to specific project needs.  
- Enhances collaboration by maintaining uniformity across projects.

## **Dev Container**  
[View on GitHub](https://github.com/aldojasb/my_devcontainer)  

A **pre-configured development environment** that ensures consistency and isolation across development setups.  

**Why it Matters?**  
Development environments can vary across machines, leading to inconsistencies and "works on my machine" issues. This dev container provides an isolated environment with all necessary tools and dependencies, ensuring that the development setup is uniform across all team members.  

**Key Features:**  
- Isolated development environment to prevent conflicts with host systems.  
- Pre-installed tools and libraries, such as Python, pyenv, and Poetry.  
- Reproducible setups ensuring consistency across different machines.  
- Simplifies onboarding for new developers by providing a ready-to-use environment.
