# Development & DevOps Overview  



## Why Development & DevOps Matter  

Modern Data Scientists **don’t stop at writing Jupyter Notebooks**. Training models or creating predictive services also involves **maintaining reliable infrastructure, automating deployments, and ensuring smooth collaboration between other Data Scientists, developers and operations teams**. By following the guides in this section, you'll gain practical knowledge to:  

Improve **developer productivity** through streamlined workflows.  
Reduce **manual effort** by automating repetitive tasks.  
Maintain **clear, well-documented projects** for better collaboration.  
Ensure **consistent and scalable** deployments.  

Stay tuned as I will add more **hands-on guides** and **best practices** to this section!
