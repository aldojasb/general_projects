## 🎯 **The MoSCoW Method**  

### 🔹 **What is the MoSCoW Method?**  

The **MoSCoW method** is a simple yet effective prioritization framework used in **Agile development** and **project management**. It helps teams decide **which features or tasks should be prioritized first** based on their importance and impact.  

### 🛠 **How It Works**  

Features, tasks, or requirements are categorized into **four priority levels**:  

1️⃣ **Must-Have** → **Critical features** that are essential for the product to function. Without these, the project **fails**.  
   - Example: A **login system** for an authentication-based app.  

2️⃣ **Should-Have** → **Important features** that significantly enhance the product but are **not critical for immediate release**.  
   - Example: **Dark mode** for an app—it improves user experience but isn't a blocker.  

3️⃣ **Could-Have** → **Nice-to-have features** that can be added **if time and resources allow** but won't negatively impact the product if omitted.  
   - Example: **Custom user themes** for personalization.  

4️⃣ **Won’t-Have (for now)** → Features that are **out of scope** for the current development cycle but could be revisited later.  
   - Example: **Multi-language support** when launching an MVP in a single market.

### 🚀 **Why It Matters**  

✔ Prevents **scope creep** by forcing teams to make trade-offs.  
✔ Aligns **stakeholders and developers** on priorities.  
✔ Helps deliver **valuable software faster** by focusing on essentials.
