##  **The Skateboard Mindset: A Practical Approach to MVPs**  

*(Based on Henrik Kniberg’s article on [Making Sense of MVP](https://blog.crisp.se/2016/01/25/henrikkniberg/making-sense-of-mvp))*

###  **What is the Skateboard Mindset?**  

The **Skateboard Mindset** is an approach to building **Minimum Viable Products (MVPs)** with a focus on **usability and value delivery** rather than just isolated functionality.  

Instead of **delivering incomplete parts of a system**, this mindset encourages teams to create **small but functional iterations** that **work from day one**.  

###  **How It Works**  

 **Traditional MVP Mindset (Flawed Approach)**  
A common mistake when building an MVP is treating it as a **step-by-step assembly of the final product**. Example:  

1. **Wheels** →  No usability yet.  
2. **Chassis** →  Still unusable.  
3. **Car Frame** →  Still not functional.  
4. **Final Car** →  Finally usable—but only at the end.  

 **The Skateboard Mindset (Better Approach)**  
Instead, we **start with a small, usable product** and **iterate towards a better version**:  

1. **Skateboard** →  Basic but functional.  
2. **Scooter** →  More comfort & usability.  
3. **Bicycle** →  Faster, scalable improvement.  
4. **Motorcycle** →  Improved efficiency.  
5. **Car** →  Fully featured, refined product.

###  **Why It Matters**  

✔ **Delivers value from day one**—each iteration is a usable product.  
✔ **Encourages user feedback early**, reducing risk.  
✔ **Prevents waste** by validating real needs before overbuilding.  

This mindset **helps teams prioritize features that deliver real user value**, ensuring software evolves in **functional, testable stages** rather than incomplete fragments.
