# 🛠️ Building AI Is Not Like Building a Bridge



Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are powerful tools, but they’re fundamentally different from traditional engineering projects. While civil or mechanical engineering relies on centuries of accumulated knowledge and deterministic principles, AI operates in a world of **uncertainty, data variability, and adaptive logic**.

Treating AI like a solved field - something to rapidly scope, plan, and deliver like clockwork - is a recipe for **disappointment**, leading to mismatched expectations, slow adoption, and underwhelming results

Here’s how it compares:

| **Traditional Engineering (e.g., Building a Bridge)**  | **AI/ML Product Development**                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Deterministic systems with well-defined inputs/outputs | Probabilistic models based on data distributions    |
| Failure is often catastrophic (and unacceptable)       | “Failure” is a learning step; iteration is expected |
| Methods validated over centuries                       | Methods still emerging and rapidly evolving         |
| Primary risk: material/environmental conditions        | Primary risk: data quality, drift, user adoption    |



But here’s the good news: with the **right mindset and framework**, AI can deliver massive value. The trick isn’t to eliminate uncertainty - it’s to **design around it**. 

**AI is a process of discovery**, not just implementation. When it is supported by a framework that **embraces uncertainty rather than ignoring it**, AI becomes a powerful enabler of real-world impact. In the next sections, I’ll share some ideas I’ve seen work throughout my career to properly address uncertainty in ML/AI projects:
