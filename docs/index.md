# Welcome to my Data Science & Software Engineering Portfolio

## A Quick Background About Me

Hi, I’m **Aldo**! 

I hold a **Master’s in Data Science** from the **University of British Columbia (UBC)** and an undergraduate degree in **Industrial/Production Engineering** 

I started to work when I was 15. **I opened my own business: a small locksmith shop in my hometown**. I spent my days making key copies and helping people who locked themselves out of their homes or cars. That experience taught me the fondations of  **customer service, business strategy, and how to adapt quickly to new technologies** Over time, I figured out a passion for math, computer science, and physics and I ended up taking a degree in production engineering. Since then, I’ve built a career **delivering data science solutions, managing projects and teams**, and working across both large corporations (like **Procter & Gamble**) and the **fast-paced startup** world, where I currently work as a Data Scientist & Manager.

Outside of work, you’ll find me **skiing down the slopes**,  **reading in a cozy coffee shop**, or **riding motorcycles** - always looking for the next adventure!



## What You Will Find Here

This portfolio brings together two key parts of my work:

- **Educational content** I’ve developed to mentor aspiring data scientists, engineers, and product teams — covering topics like software architecture, MLOps, and real-world AI systems.
- **Professional services** I offer as a Software & AI Consultant — helping companies turn business problems into scalable, production-grade AI solutions.

Whether you’re here to learn, collaborate, or explore how I can support your company, you’ll find practical knowledge and a problem-first approach to building AI that works.




## How I Can Help Your Business

I build AI products that start with real business problem and end with software your clients will actually use. Here are some ways I help companies grow with software and AI:



- **Custom AI Systems** – Design and build AI tools that integrate with your existing architecture.
- **AI Readiness Assessments** – Evaluate your infrastructure, data, and teams before you invest.
- **From prototype to products** – Refactor prototypes into scalable, production-ready products.
- **Visualization Dashboards** – Build a single source of truth to unlock insights and align teams.
- **Team Coaching & Workshops** – Upskill technical teams and train business teams in AI fluency.
- **Digital Twin Simulations** – Model and simulate industrial processes for smarter decisions.
- **Innovation Lab Setup** – Create internal structures for experimentation and deployment.

## Lessons I Share with Mentees and Teams

This section showcases my expertise in **software architecture, data science, MLOps, and applied AI workflows**. Whether you’re diving into design patterns, refining your testing strategies, or exploring machine learning concepts, you’ll find content to accelerate learning and apply best practices in real-world projects.

- **[Software Architecture](guides/software_architecture/overview)**: The (invisible) force driving business success - Principles and patterns for **designing flexible, scalable, and maintainable systems** (e.g. **[SOLID principles](guides/software_architecture/SOLID_principles)**). 
- **[AI Product Management](guides/ai_product_development/overview)**: Practical ideas for **managing uncertainty, making smart bets, and avoiding common pitfalls in real-world AI/ML product development**. 
- **[Data Science & AI](guides/data_science_and_ai/overview)**: Key concepts and learning projects in **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**, covering topics like **autoencoders, reinforcement learning, and more**. 
- **[Development & MLOps](guides/development_and_devops/overview)**: Best practices in **pytest for testing**, **Dev Containers** for stable environments, **CI/CD integration**, and more. 
- **[Demos](guides/demos/overview)**: A showcase of real-world applications that reinforce these concepts through hands-on implementation.
