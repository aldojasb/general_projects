# Welcome to my Data Science & Software Engineering Portfolio



## A Quick Background About Me

Hi, I’m **Aldo**! 

I hold a **Master’s in Data Science** from the **University of British Columbia (UBC)** and an undergraduate degree in **Industrial Engineering** 

My journey in coding began at **Procter & Gamble (P&G)**, where I gained experience working in a **large corporate environment**. Now, I’m part of the **dynamic world of startups**, working as a **Data Scientist & Software Engineer** at Turing.

I have a deep passion for **continuous learning** - exploring new technologies, optimizing software solutions, and tackling complex data challenges.  

Outside of work, you’ll find me **skiing down the slopes**,  **reading in a cozy coffee shop**, or **riding motorcycles** 🏍️ - always looking for the next adventure! 



## Purpose of This Portfolio

This portfolio highlights my expertise in **software architecture, data science, DevOps, workflows, and applied projects**. It serves both as a **learning resource** and a **technical showcase** for developers, mentees, recruiters, and potential clients. Whether you're exploring software design patterns, improving your testing skills, or diving into AI/ML concepts, you’ll find structured content designed to facilitate learning and best practices.
