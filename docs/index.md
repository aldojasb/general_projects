# Welcome to my Data Science & Software Engineering Portfolio



## **A Quick Background About Me**

Hi, I’m **Aldo**! 

I hold a **Master’s in Data Science** from the **University of British Columbia (UBC)** and an undergraduate degree in **Industrial/Production Engineering** 

I started to work when I was 15. **I opened my own business: a small locksmith shop in my hometown**. I spent my days making key copies and helping people who locked themselves out of their homes or cars. That experience taught me the fondations of  **customer service, business strategy, and how to adapt quickly to new technologies.** Over time, I figured out a passion for math, computer science, and physics and I ended up taking a degree in production engineering. Since then, I’ve built a career **delivering data science solutions, managing projects and teams**, and working across both large corporations (like **Procter & Gamble**) and the **fast-paced startups**, where I currently work as a Data Scientist & Manager.

Outside of work, you’ll find me skiing down the slopes,  reading in a cozy coffee shop, or riding motorcycles - always looking for the next adventure!



## **What You Will Find Here**

This portfolio brings together two key parts of my work:

- **Educational content:** I mentor aspiring data scientists, engineers, and product teams, covering topics like software architecture, MLOps, and real-world AI systems.
- **Professional services:** I offer as a Software & AI Consultant, helping companies turn business problems into scalable AI solutions.

Whether you’re here to learn, collaborate, or explore how I can support your company, you’ll find practical knowledge to building AI that works.




## **How I Can Help Your Business**

I build AI products that start with real business problems and end with a software that your clients will actually use. My services are divided into two complementary areas:



### AI Systems That Work

[*Build solutions that integrate, scale, and deliver real-world impact.*](guides/work_with_me/ai_systems_that_work.md)

- **Custom AI Systems** – Design and build AI tools that plug into your existing architecture.
- **From Prototype to Product** – Refactor notebooks, scripts, or research models into scalable, maintainable software.
- **Visualization Dashboards** – Create unified dashboards to generate insights, monitor systems, and align teams across the company.
- **Digital Twin Simulations** – Build virtual environments to simulate industrial processes and train AI systems like reinforcement learning agents.

### AI Foundations & Capability Building

[*Lay the groundwork to scale AI confidently and sustainably.*](guides/work_with_me/ai_foundations_and_capability_building.md)

- **AI Readiness Assessments** – Evaluate your data, infrastructure, and team setup before making costly AI investments.
- **Innovation Lab Setup** – Design and launch internal AI or R&D teams to experiment, deploy, and scale innovation.
- **Team Coaching & Workshops** – Upskill technical teams in production-grade AI and mentor them through engineering best practices.
- **AI Culture Training** – Educate business stakeholders to collaborate with AI teams and foster data-driven thinking.

## **Lessons I Share with Mentees and Teams**

This section showcases my expertise in **software architecture, data science, MLOps, and applied AI workflows**. Whether you’re diving into design patterns, refining your testing strategies, or exploring machine learning concepts, you’ll find content to accelerate learning and apply best practices in real-world projects.

- **[Software Architecture](guides/software_architecture/overview)**: The (invisible) force driving business success - Principles and patterns for **designing flexible, scalable, and maintainable systems** (e.g. **[SOLID principles](guides/software_architecture/SOLID_principles)**). 
- **[AI Product Management](guides/ai_product_development/overview)**: Practical ideas for **managing uncertainty, making smart bets, and avoiding common pitfalls in real-world AI/ML product development**. 
- **[Data Science & AI](guides/data_science_and_ai/overview)**: Key concepts and learning projects in **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**, covering topics like **autoencoders, reinforcement learning, and more**. 
- **[Development & MLOps](guides/development_and_devops/overview)**: Best practices in **pytest for testing**, **Dev Containers** for stable environments, **CI/CD integration**, and more. 
- **[Demos](guides/demos/overview)**: A showcase of real-world applications that reinforce these concepts through hands-on implementation.
