# Welcome to My Software & Data Science Portfolio 🚀



## 👋 A Quick Background About Me

Hi, I’m **Aldo**! 

🎓 I hold a **Master’s in Data Science** from the **University of British Columbia (UBC)** and an undergraduate degree in **Industrial Engineering** 

💼 My journey in coding began at **Procter & Gamble (P&G)**, where I gained experience working in a **large corporate environment**. Now, I’m part of the **dynamic world of startups**, working as a **Data Scientist & Software Developer** at **Turing** 🚀.

🧠 I have a deep passion for **continuous learning**—exploring new technologies, optimizing software solutions, and tackling complex data challenges.  

Outside of work, you’ll find me **skiing down the slopes**⛷️,  **reading in a cozy coffee shop** ☕, or **riding dirt bikes** 🏍️ - always looking for the next adventure! 🌄
